# Suicide Prevention & Mental Health Analytics Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

Suicide is a major public health concern worldwide, influenced by social, economic, psychological, and demographic factors. Although large amounts of data are available from global and national sources, these datasets are often difficult to analyze due to their size and complexity.  

This project aims to transform raw suicide statistics into meaningful and interactive insights using **Power BI**. The dashboard enables multi-level analysis, including global trends, India-specific patterns, state-level (Tamil Nadu) deep dives, age-based risk analysis, and summary insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global and Indian suicide datasets using Power BI  
- Clean and transform data using **Power Query (ETL)**  
- Apply **Unpivot** and **Group By** operations for data reshaping and aggregation  
- Create **DAX measures** for KPIs and calculations  
- Build interactive dashboards with **drill-down, filters, and navigation buttons**  
- Provide clear visual insights for better understanding of trends and risk factors

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

- WHO Global Suicide Statistics (Country, Year, Gender, Age, Rate, etc.)  
- India Suicide Data (State-wise, Year-wise, Gender, Age Group, etc.)  
- Additional datasets for age groups, causes, and regional analysis  

(All datasets are used only for academic and analytical purposes.)

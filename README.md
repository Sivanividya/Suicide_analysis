# Suicide Prevention & Mental Health Analytics Dashboard

# Project Overview
Suicide is a serious public health issue worldwide and is influenced by social, economic, psychological, and demographic factors. Although a large amount of data is available from global and national sources, this data is often difficult to explore because of its size and complexity.

This project focuses on turning raw suicide statistics into clear and easy-to-understand insights using Power BI. The dashboard allows analysis at different levels, including global trends, India-specific patterns, a detailed view of Tamil Nadu, age-based analysis, and overall summary views. The goal is to make the data easier to explore and understand for better analysis and discussion.

## Objectives
- Analyze global and Indian suicide datasets using Power BI  
- Clean and prepare data using Power Query (ETL)  
- Use Unpivot and Group By to reshape and summarize data  
- Create DAX measures for key calculations and indicators  
- Build interactive dashboards with filters, drill-down, and navigation buttons  
- Present trends and patterns in a clear and understandable way

## Datasets Used
- WHO Global Suicide Statistics (Country, Year, Gender, Age, Rate, etc.)  
- India Suicide Data (State-wise, Year-wise, Gender, Age Group, etc.)  
- Additional datasets for age groups, causes, and regional analysis  

All datasets are used only for academic and analytical purposes.


## Dashboard Pages

## Concepts and Features Used
- Power Query (ETL) for data cleaning and preparation  
- Unpivot to convert wide tables into long format (age, gender, causes)  
- Group By to create summaries (year-wise, state-wise, etc.)  
- DAX measures for totals, averages, rankings, trends, and KPIs  
- Drill-down and drill-through for detailed analysis  
- Slicers and filters for interactive exploration  
- Buttons and page navigation for easy movement between pages  
- Advanced visuals such as conditional formatting and decomposition tree (where applicable)  

## How to Use the Project
1. Open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop  
2. Use the Home page buttons to move between different dashboards  
3. Use slicers and filters to explore data by year, region, gender, and age group  
4. Interact with visuals using drill-down and drill-through features  
5. Review insights from global, national, state-level, and age-based views  

## Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query Editor  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- CSV / Excel datasets  

## Output Files
- `.pbix` Power BI report file  
- Exported PDF or PPT for presentation and documentation (optional)  

## Conclusion
This project shows how Power BI can be used to turn complex public health data into clear and useful visual reports. By exploring the data at global, national, and state levels, the dashboard helps highlight important patterns, high-risk groups, and regional differences, making the analysis easier to understand and discuss.
